Building Generative AI Applications – exclusive workshop for esynergy associates
Workshop for esynergy LA and the wider community- this is going to be 100% virtual course. 
Date and time : GMT evening after 5 pm in the week starting 11th of December; will give more specific details for registered individuals.
This course prepares you to build solutions that leverage generative AI features to make discovery easier, faster, and more effective. The course consists of presentations, demos, and hands-on labs where you work with GenAI models and services and build realistic GenAI search applications.
Learning Objectives
After successfully completing this course, you will be able to:
•	Identify opportunities to leverage GenAI-enabled search solutions for multiple use cases.
•	Understand key concepts specific to GenAI search, such as embeddings, vector search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
•	Evaluate various technology stacks and select architectures best suited for their use cases.
•	Design solutions using best practices
•	Begin building search applications from scratch or by using managed platforms.
Who should attend?
This course is designed for developers, solution architects, and others involved in the design, development, and operation of software systems. You need to have good Python skills.
